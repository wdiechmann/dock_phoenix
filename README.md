# Docker Provisioning of Elixir/Phoenix App

## What the eff is this?

A series of talks on the subject - this index.html is the slides to go with it
and the repo holds the "examples"

- meetup (a first naive implementation with only a mysql db)
- all_n (an example with all services running as containers)
- ci_ing (an example with continous integration)
- deploy (and finally the deploy)

## How do I get started?

Install your flavour of Docker (go read about what derivatives exist on your OS platform; 
my understanding is that Windows holds a few surprises for your benefit)

Start a webserver in the presentation folder - on a macOS you could do ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000```
and visit localhost:5000 in your browser
